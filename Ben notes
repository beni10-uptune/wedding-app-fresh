    Need to ask questions like: add your contributions for ceremony. or tailored for each person (eg we love your 80s taste, give us 3 songs)
    Guests should be able to add songs using the code on a dedicated page. they can add songs via the Spotify API. These then need to be handled properly and either added to a list or in a place for the couple to add
Once paid, the user should be able to add their couple to collaborate
Export to DJ. Can be in a PDF and as a Spotify playlist. Research needed about how the DJ will want it
Settings in dashboard. do we need it?
Templates! this is great idea and we should have them as a USP in the dashboard.
