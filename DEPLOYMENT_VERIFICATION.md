## 🔍 How to Verify Deployment

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard

- Should show "Ready" status
- Check build logs for any errors

### 2. Test Critical User Flows

#### A. New User Signup
1. Go to `/auth/signup`
2. Create account with email
3. Fill out wedding creation form (5 steps)
4. Click "Create Wedding" → Should redirect to dashboard
5. Dashboard should show free tier limits (25 songs, 5 guests)

#### B. Returning Free User Login
1. Go to `/auth/login`
2. Login with existing free account
3. **Should go to `/dashboard` NOT `/wedding/[id]/payment`** ✅
4. Can use app with free tier limits

#### C. Payment Page Access
1. Click "Upgrade to Premium" from dashboard
2. Payment page should show:
   - "Continue with Free Plan →" link in header
   - Free vs Premium comparison
   - "or continue with the free plan" link below payment form

### 3. Firebase Status
- ✅ Rules deployed and active
- ✅ Indexes deployed (may still be building)
- Check Firebase Console for any errors

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Free Tier Users:
- Can login and access dashboard
- Can add up to 25 songs
- Can invite up to 5 guests
- See upgrade prompts but NOT forced to pay
- Can voluntarily upgrade anytime

### What Was Fixed:
1. **Login redirect** - No more automatic payment page redirect
2. **Create wedding** - Form validation and serverTimestamp fixes
3. **Dashboard access** - Fallback queries for missing indexes
4. **Payment page** - Added free plan continuation options

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

1. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check browser console** - Look for specific errors
3. **Verify environment variables** in Vercel:
   - Firebase config (should be set)
   - Stripe keys (needed for payments)
   - Resend API key (needed for emails)

## ✅ Success Metrics

- Users can complete signup → wedding creation → dashboard
- Free users can login without payment redirect
- Payment page allows continuing with free plan
- No "database not configured" errors
- Create wedding button works properly

The freemium model is now fully functional! Users can enjoy the free tier (25 songs, 5 guests) without being forced to pay.
