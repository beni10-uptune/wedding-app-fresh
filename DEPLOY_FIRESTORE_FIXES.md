# Deploy Firestore Fixes

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Deploy Firestore Rules and Indexes

Run these commands to deploy the simplified Firestore rules and required indexes:

```bash
# Deploy both rules and indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore

# Or deploy them separately:
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### 2. Monitor Index Building

After deploying indexes, they need time to build. Check the Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Indexes
2. Wait for all indexes to show "Enabled" status
3. This can take 5-10 minutes

### 3. Test the Application

Once indexes are built, test these flows:
1. **Signup Flow** (both email and Google)
2. **Login Flow** (both email and Google)
3. **Dashboard Access**
4. **Wedding Creation**

### 4. If Errors Persist

If you still see "database not configured" errors:

1. Check browser console for specific error codes
2. Visit `/test-firebase` to run diagnostic tests
3. Check Firebase Console > Firestore > Usage for any quota issues

## What Was Fixed

1. **Simplified Firestore Rules** - Removed complex logic that was causing errors
2. **Added Retry Logic** - All Firestore operations now retry on failure
3. **Better Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
4. **Ensured User Documents** - User documents are created reliably
5. **Added Fallback Queries** - If complex queries fail, simpler ones are tried
6. **Created Required Indexes** - All compound queries now have indexes
