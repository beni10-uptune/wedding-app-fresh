# Project Recovery Status ✅

## Successfully Completed

### 1. Git Repository Fixed
- Created fresh clone at: `~/Desktop/wedding-app-fresh-clean`
- Successfully pushed test commit to verify everything works
- No more "counting objects" hanging issues
- Clean git history with no corruption

### 2. Working Directory Structure
```
~/Desktop/
├── wedding-app-fresh-clean/     # ✅ Your new working directory
│   └── (clean Next.js project)
└── wedding-app-fresh/           # ⚠️  Old corrupted (can be deleted)
    └── EXECUTE_RECOVERY_NOW.sh
```

### 3. Deployment Status
- **Vercel**: ✅ Auto-deploying from main branch
- **URL**: https://weddings.uptune.xyz
- **Project**: uptune-wedding
- **Check deployment**: https://vercel.com/beni10-uptunes-projects/uptune-wedding

### 4. What Was Preserved Locally
In the old directory (wedding-app-fresh), these remain local only:
- Google Ads campaigns and strategy
- Image generation scripts
- Vertex AI setup files
- All the git fix scripts

### 5. Dependencies Status
All dependencies are connected and working:
- ✅ **GitHub**: Repository connected, pushes working
- ✅ **Vercel**: Auto-deploy on push to main
- ✅ **Firebase**: No changes needed, credentials in Vercel env
- ✅ **Stripe**: No changes needed, API keys in Vercel env
- ✅ **Spotify API**: No changes needed, credentials in Vercel env
- ✅ **Domain**: weddings.uptune.xyz pointing correctly

## Next Steps

### For Development
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/wedding-app-fresh-clean
npm install
npm run dev
```

### To Add Blog Content & Images
Since the blog files weren't in the corrupted directory, when you're ready:
1. Add your blog content to `apps/wedding/content/blog/`
2. Optimize images before adding (max 1920px width, 85% quality)
3. Commit and push - Vercel will auto-deploy

### Google Ads Strategy
Your competitive Google Ads campaigns remain private in:
`~/Desktop/wedding-app-fresh/apps/wedding/google-ads/`

Copy them to a secure location if needed.

## Summary
✅ Git repository fixed and working
✅ Successful push to GitHub  
✅ Vercel auto-deployment verified
✅ All services connected
✅ Google Ads strategy kept private
✅ Clean, deployable codebase

Your project is saved and fully operational! 🎉
