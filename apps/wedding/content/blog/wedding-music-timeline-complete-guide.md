## 12+ Months Before: Setting Your Music Foundation

### Define Your Music Style Together
Start with the big picture. What atmosphere do you want? Sit down together and discuss:
- Formal or relaxed vibes?
- Traditional or contemporary music?
- Live band energy or curated playlists?
- Cultural or religious music requirements?

**Action items:**
- Create a shared Pinterest board for music inspiration
- List 10 songs that represent your relationship
- Note any absolute "must-plays" and "do-not-plays"
- Discuss budget allocation for music (typically 5-10% of total budget)

### Research Your Venue's Music Policies
Before falling in love with any music plans, check your venue's rules:
- Sound restrictions or curfews
- Required licenses or permissions
- Preferred vendor lists
- Equipment provisions or restrictions

ðŸ’¡ **Pro tip**: Some venues have sound limiters that cut power if music exceeds certain decibels. Know this early!

## 9-12 Months Before: Making Key Decisions

### Choose Your Music Approach
Time to decide between:

**Professional DJ** (Â£350-Â£1,500)
- Pros: Experience, equipment, MC services
- Cons: Less personal control, availability

**Live Band** (Â£1,000-Â£5,000)
- Pros: Unique energy, memorable experience
- Cons: Higher cost, limited song selection

**DIY Playlist** (Â£25-Â£200)
- Pros: Complete control, budget-friendly
- Cons: Requires coordination, equipment needed

### Book Your Music Vendors
If hiring professionals:
- Research and contact 5-8 options
- Schedule meetings or calls
- Review contracts carefully
- Book your favourite (popular dates fill fast!)

If going DIY:
- Start building your music planning system
- Research equipment rental options
- Identify your "music person" for the day

## 6-9 Months Before: Building Your Foundation

### Create Your Music Framework
Map out music needs for each moment:

**Ceremony** (30-45 minutes)
- Prelude: 20-30 minutes
- Processional: 5-10 minutes  
- Ceremony music: 2-3 songs
- Recessional: 1 song

**Cocktail Hour** (60 minutes)
- 15-20 background songs
- Light, conversational volume

**Reception** (4-5 hours)
- Grand entrance: 1 song
- Dinner: 90 minutes (25-30 songs)
- First dance: 1 special song
- Parent dances: 2 songs
- Party time: 3-4 hours (60-80 songs)
- Last dance: 1 memorable finale

### Start Your Master Song List
Begin collecting songs for each moment. Don't worry about final decisions yet - just gather options:
- Browse wedding music galleries
- Ask recently married friends
- Check wedding forums and blogs
- Save songs you hear and love

**UpTune makes this easy**: Our visual timeline lets you drag and drop songs into each wedding moment, seeing your whole day at a glance.

## 3-6 Months Before: Getting Specific

### Finalize Key Moment Songs
Lock in your non-negotiables:
- First dance song (consider dance lessons?)
- Processional music
- Recessional celebration
- Parent dance selections
- Last dance choice

### Create Your Do-Not-Play List
Equally important! Include:
- Songs with bad memories
- Overplayed wedding clichÃ©s (unless you love them!)
- Inappropriate lyrics for family audiences
- Genres that don't fit your vibe

### Coordinate Special Performances
If including live elements:
- Friend singing during ceremony
- Surprise flash mob
- Special dedications
- Cultural performances

Give performers plenty of notice and coordinate with your venue.

## 1-3 Months Before: Refining and Finalizing

### Open Guest Song Requests
Create a system for guest input:
- Add a line to RSVP cards
- Share an online form
- Create boundaries (e.g., "reception only")
- Reserve veto power!

**Smart approach**: Ask for 2-3 suggestions per guest, promising to play at least one if appropriate.

### Build Final Playlists
Organize songs by reception flow:

**Dinner Playlist Example**
- Start mellow (jazz, acoustic)
- Build slightly through courses
- Include multiple genres
- Keep volume conversation-friendly

**Dancing Playlist Strategy**
- Begin with crowd-pleasers
- Mix fast and slow (80/20 ratio)
- Include songs from multiple decades
- Plan energy peaks and valleys
- End on a high note

### Meet with Music Vendors
If using professionals:
- Share your must-play list
- Provide do-not-play list
- Discuss timeline and special moments
- Confirm equipment and setup needs
- Designate day-of contact person

## 2-4 Weeks Before: Final Preparations

### Create Detailed Timeline Documents
Your DJ/band/music coordinator needs:
- Minute-by-minute ceremony timeline
- Reception flow with time estimates
- Pronunciation guide for names
- Special instructions for key moments
- Emergency contact information

### Test Everything (If DIY)
- Visit venue with devices
- Test sound levels
- Check all cables and connections
- Ensure WiFi/data backup
- Create equipment checklist

### Prepare Backup Plans
Because technology fails:
- Download all music for offline play
- Bring backup devices
- Have alternative speakers
- Keep printed timeline copies
- Identify backup music person

## Wedding Week: Final Touches

### Monday-Wednesday
- Final playlist review
- Charge all devices
- Pack equipment and cables
- Print timeline copies
- Confirm vendor arrival times

### Thursday-Friday  
- Rehearsal walkthrough with music cues
- Final vendor check-in
- Load music onto multiple devices
- Brief wedding party on entrances

### Wedding Day
- Arrive early for setup (or ensure vendors do)
- Designate someone to cue moments
- Keep timeline copies handy
- Trust your preparation
- Dance and celebrate!

## Common Timeline Mistakes to Avoid

### Starting Too Late
"We thought music was easy - just make a playlist, right? Wrong! Starting 2 months before meant rushing everything." - Sarah, married 2024

**Solution**: Start your music planning when you book your venue.

### Forgetting Dinner Music
Many couples focus on dancing but forget the 90-minute dinner period needs music too.

**Solution**: Plan 2 hours of dinner-appropriate music.

### No Clear Communication
Your DJ can't read minds. Vague instructions lead to awkward moments.

**Solution**: Over-communicate with detailed timelines and song lists.

### Ignoring Guest Demographics
Playing only your favourite indie tracks? Grandma might not dance.

**Solution**: Include songs from multiple decades and genres.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should we book our DJ or band?
Popular wedding vendors book 9-12 months in advance, especially for peak season (May-September). Start researching at least 10 months before your date.

### How many songs do we actually need?
For a typical wedding: 10-15 ceremony songs, 15-20 cocktail hour songs, 25-30 dinner songs, and 60-80 dance songs. That's roughly 110-145 total songs.

### What if we're between a DJ and DIY playlist?
Consider a hybrid: DIY for ceremony and dinner (easier to manage), then DJ for dancing (when energy matters most). This can save money while ensuring party success.

### Should we take all guest requests?
No! Accept suggestions but maintain veto power. A good rule: promise to play at least one appropriate request per guest who provides them.

### How do we handle music for photos?
Plan 45-60 minutes of background music for photography time. Choose songs that won't distract but keep energy up. Your photographer will thank you!
