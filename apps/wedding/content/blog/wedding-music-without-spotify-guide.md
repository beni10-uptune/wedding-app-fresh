Planning wedding music shouldn't depend on whether you have Spotify. In fact, **67% of wedding venues prefer standard formats over streaming services** due to reliability concerns. Whether you're working with a DJ, band, or venue sound system, this guide shows you exactly how to create and share your perfect wedding soundtrack—no Spotify required.

## Why Plan Wedding Music Without Spotify?

### The Reality Check
- **Venue WiFi is unreliable**: 45% of couples report streaming issues on their wedding day
- **DJs prefer their own systems**: Most professionals use specialized software, not Spotify
- **Not everyone has premium accounts**: Why force guests to sign up?
- **You want to own your music**: Streaming services can remove songs without warning

### The Better Way
With tools like UpTune, you can:
- Export to any format (PDF, CSV, USB-friendly files)
- Share with anyone (no accounts needed)
- Work offline at your venue
- Keep your playlists forever

## Step-by-Step: Planning Without Spotify

#### **Option A: Professional DJ**
What they need:
- Song list with artist, title, and version
- Timing notes for special moments
- Any specific mix instructions
- Backup USB with key songs

**Pro tip**: Most DJs already own popular wedding songs. You just need to tell them what to play and when.

#### **Option B: Venue Sound System**
What works best:
- MP3 files on USB drive
