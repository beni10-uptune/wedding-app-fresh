  ↩️ 7-Day Guarantee
</div>

<!-- Progress indicator -->
<div class="checkout-progress">

  content: {
    headline: "Wait! Save your playlist",
    offer: "Get 50% off your first month",
    urgency: "This offer won't be shown again",
    cta: "Claim Discount"
  },
  conversionRate: '12% of abandoners'
};
```

#### Email Recovery Sequence
1. **1 hour**: "Your playlist is waiting" + direct link
2. **24 hours**: "50% discount expires soon" + urgency
3. **72 hours**: "See what others created" + social proof
4. **7 days**: "Last chance" + bigger discount

## Stage 6: Activation & Retention

### First Session Success

#### Onboarding Checklist
```typescript
const OnboardingTasks = [

```

### Retention Mechanics

#### Engagement Loops

```

## Testing Framework

### A/B Testing Priority Matrix

#### High Impact Tests (Do First)
1. **First input field** (must-play vs. location vs. date)
2. **CTA button text** (variations above)
3. **Pricing display** (order and highlighting)
4. **Modal trigger point** (time vs. interaction based)

#### Medium Impact Tests
1. **Form fields** (progressive vs. all-at-once)
2. **Social proof placement** (top vs. modal vs. inline)
3. **Color schemes** (purple gradient variations)
4. **Progress indicators** (visual styles)

#### Low Impact Tests
1. **Microcopy variations**
2. **Icon choices**
3. **Animation speeds**
4. **Footer content**

### Testing Methodology

#### Statistical Significance
```typescript
const TestConfig = {
  minSampleSize: 1000, // per variant
  confidenceLevel: 0.95,
  minimumEffect: 0.05, // 5% improvement minimum
  testDuration: 14, // days
  
  // Automatic winner selection
  autoSelect: true,
  autoSelectThreshold: 0.99 // 99% confidence
};
```

## Analytics & Measurement

### KPI Dashboard

#### Real-time Metrics
```typescript
const RealtimeMetrics = {
  activeUsers: 'Current on site',
  conversionRate: 'Last 24 hours',
  revenueRate: 'Hourly revenue',
  experimentStatus: 'Active A/B tests'
};
```

#### Daily Metrics
- Visitor → Engagement rate
- Engagement → Signup rate
- Signup → Activation rate
- Activation → Paid rate
- Churn rate
- Average customization depth
- Time to conversion

#### Weekly Cohorts
- Retention curves
- LTV progression
- Feature adoption
- Upgrade patterns

### Attribution Model

#### Multi-touch Attribution
```typescript
const AttributionWeights = {
  firstTouch: 0.3,  // How they found us
  lastTouch: 0.4,   // What convinced them
  linear: 0.3       // Journey influence
};

// Track complete journey
const UserJourney = {
  source: 'google/organic',
  landing: '/blog/first-dance-songs',
  interactions: ['read_article', 'click_cta', 'use_builder'],
  conversion: 'v3_modal',
  value: 25.00
};
```

## Conversion Psychology Deep Dive

### Cognitive Biases We Leverage

#### 1. Endowment Effect
Once users customize, they feel ownership
```
Implementation: "Your playlist" language everywhere
Impact: 35% increase in save attempts
```

#### 2. IKEA Effect
Users value what they help create
```
Implementation: Progressive customization
Impact: 2x higher retention for customizers
```

#### 3. Social Proof Bias
People follow others' actions
```
Implementation: "10,000+ couples" messaging
Impact: 18% conversion lift
```

#### 4. Anchoring Bias
First price sets expectation
```
Implementation: Show $49 plan first
Impact: 22% more choose $25 plan
```

### Emotional Journey Mapping

#### Emotional States by Stage
1. **Curiosity** → "What would my playlist look like?"
2. **Delight** → "This is actually good!"
3. **Investment** → "I'm making it mine"
4. **Anxiety** → "I might lose this"
5. **Relief** → "It's saved"
6. **Pride** → "Look what I created"

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Machine Learning Applications

#### Personalization Engine
```python
# Predict conversion probability
def predict_conversion(user_features):
    features = {
        'customization_depth': user_features['interactions'],
        'time_on_page': user_features['duration'],
        'device_type': user_features['device'],
        'traffic_source': user_features['source'],
        'songs_added': user_features['songs_added']
    }
    
    # ML model trained on historical data
    probability = conversion_model.predict(features)
    
    # Adjust experience based on probability
    if probability < 0.2:
        return 'aggressive_prompts'
    elif probability < 0.5:
        return 'standard_flow'
    else:
        return 'minimal_friction'
```

#### Dynamic Pricing
```typescript
const DynamicPricing = {
  factors: {
    daysUntilWedding: -0.3,  // Urgency factor
    competitorPricing: 0.2,   // Market factor
    userEngagement: -0.4,     // Willingness factor
    seasonality: 0.1          // Demand factor
  },
  
  calculatePrice(basePrice: number, userContext: Context): number {
    let multiplier = 1.0;
    
    // Apply factors
    for (const [factor, weight] of Object.entries(this.factors)) {
      multiplier += userContext[factor] * weight;
    }
    
    return Math.round(basePrice * multiplier);
  }
};
```

### Behavioral Triggers

#### Smart Notification System
```typescript
const BehavioralTriggers = {
  // Re-engagement
  dormant3Days: {
    channel: 'email',
    message: 'Your playlist misses you',
    incentive: 'New songs added'
  },
  
  // Upgrade prompts
  highEngagement: {
    channel: 'in-app',
    message: 'You're a power user!',
    incentive: '50% off Professional'
  },
  
  // Social proof
  partnerJoined: {
    channel: 'notification',
    message: 'Sarah just customized 5 songs',
    action: 'View changes'
  }
};
```

## International Conversion Strategy

### Localization Matrix

#### Regional Adaptations
