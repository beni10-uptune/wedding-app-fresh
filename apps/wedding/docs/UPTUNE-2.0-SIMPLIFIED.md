## 📱 Technical Simplification

### Spotify Playlist Import (No OAuth):
```javascript
// User pastes: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/xyz
const importPlaylist = async (url) => {
  // Extract playlist ID
  const playlistId = extractId(url);
  
  // Fetch public data (no auth needed)
  const tracks = await fetchPublicPlaylist(playlistId);
  
  // Analyze music DNA
  const analysis = analyzeTracklist(tracks);
  
  // Influence AI generation
  return {
    genres: analysis.topGenres,
    energy: analysis.avgEnergy,
    favoriteSongs: tracks.slice(0, 20)
  };
};
```

### Cost Optimization:
- **Before email**: No API calls (just static previews)
