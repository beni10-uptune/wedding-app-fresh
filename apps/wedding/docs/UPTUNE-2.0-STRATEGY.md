## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Pain Points:
1. **Couples are overwhelmed** - 200+ songs needed, don't know where to start
2. **Generic playlists don't work** - Every wedding is unique (culture, age, style)
3. **DIY is time-consuming** - Hours searching, discussing, arguing
4. **DJs are expensive** - ¬£1,500+ for music curation alone
5. **Guest requests are chaotic** - WhatsApp messages, lost notes, inappropriate songs

### Why Current Solutions Fail:
- **ChatGPT**: Generic lists, no Spotify integration, no wedding structure
- **Spotify playlists**: Static, not personalized, no guest input
- **Wedding DJs**: $1,500+, often play the same tired songs
- **DIY**: Takes 40+ hours, causes stress and arguments
