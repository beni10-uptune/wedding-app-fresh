## 🎯 Why This Beats ChatGPT

### Side-by-side Comparison:
```
ChatGPT Playlist:          vs    UpTune Playlist:
"Here are 50 songs"              "Here are 150 songs"
Random order                      Structured by moment
No regional context              North England favorites
Generic suggestions              Based on YOUR Spotify
Text list                        Playable, exportable
No timing                        Timed to sunset
No acoustic consideration        Garden-optimized
```

### Wedding-Specific Intelligence:
```
What ChatGPT doesn't know:
❌ "Mr. Brightside" is mandatory at UK weddings
❌ Garden venues need different bass levels
❌ Processional should be 2-3 minutes exactly
❌ Energy should peak at 10pm, not midnight
❌ Never play "Every Breath You Take" (creepy lyrics)
❌ Regional differences (North vs South England)
❌ How to blend your music taste with crowd pleasers
```

### Throughout the Experience:
```
Educational Moments:
"Did you know? In North England, no wedding 
is complete without Oasis. We've added Wonderwall 
to your peak party section."

"For garden venues, we avoid songs with heavy 
sub-bass that gets lost outdoors. We've swapped 
7 songs for better acoustic matches."

"Based on your Arctic Monkeys love, we've added 
3 deeper cuts that your indie friends will 
appreciate but mainstream guests will still enjoy."
