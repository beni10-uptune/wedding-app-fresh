## 💡 Live Educational Moments

As they customize, we educate:

```
"COCKTAILS (90 minutes, 25 songs)
We keep energy at 110-120 BPM here - upbeat enough 
to create atmosphere but not so intense that 
people can't chat. Notice we sneak in your 
Arctic Monkeys between crowd-pleasers..."

"DINNER (90 minutes, 23 songs)  
Dropping to 90-100 BPM for conversation. 
We've front-loaded familiar songs while people 
are finding seats, then ease into your 
indie preferences as wine flows..."

"PARTY BUILD (45 minutes, 12 songs)
This is crucial - we gradually increase from 
115 to 125 BPM. Starting with 'September' 
gets everyone up, then we build energy 
systematically. Your Manchester anthems 
hit when crowd is warmed up..."
