üîê Enable Anonymous Authentication in Firebase

To allow the import script to work, you need to enable anonymous authentication:

1. Go to Firebase Console:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/weddings-uptune-d12fa/authentication/providers

2. Click on "Anonymous" in the Sign-in providers list

3. Toggle the "Enable" switch to ON

4. Click "Save"

5. Deploy the updated Firestore rules:
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

Once enabled, the import script will be able to:
- Authenticate anonymously with Firebase
- Write to the songs_master collection
- Import songs from Spotify

Note: Anonymous auth is safe for import scripts as:
- It only grants temporary access
- The Firestore rules still require authentication
- No personal data is exposed
`);

console.log(`
üìù Current Firestore Rules for songs_master:

    match /songs_master/{songId} {
      allow read: if true;                    // Anyone can read
      allow create: if request.auth != null;  // Any authenticated user (including anonymous)
      allow update: if request.auth != null;  // Any authenticated user (including anonymous)
      allow delete: if false;                 // No one can delete
    }

These rules allow the import script to write data while still requiring authentication.
