# Product Requirements Document: Onboarding Flow Optimization

## Executive Summary

The current onboarding flow has critical technical issues and UX friction points that prevent users from successfully creating their wedding and converting to paid customers. This PRD outlines a complete redesign of the onboarding experience to maximize signups, minimize drop-offs, and drive paid conversions.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points:
1. **Technical Failures**: Users cannot complete onboarding due to Firebase permissions error
2. **Authentication Issues**: Users must re-login after signup, breaking the flow
3. **Redundant Data Entry**: Names collected twice, creating frustration
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Generic alerts instead of helpful guidance
5. **Unclear Value Proposition**: Users don't understand why they should pay
6. **No Progress Indication**: Users don't know how many steps remain
7. **Scroll Position Issues**: Page doesn't reset to top between steps

### Business Impact:
- **Lost Conversions**: Users abandon at critical "create wedding" step
- **Poor First Impression**: Technical errors damage trust
- **Reduced Word-of-Mouth**: Frustrated users won't recommend the product

2. **Increase Free-to-Paid Conversion** from current (unknown) to 15%+
3. **Reduce Time-to-Value** from signup to first playlist < 3 minutes
4. **Achieve NPS Score** of 40+ for onboarding experience

### Key Metrics:
- Signup start â†’ completion rate
- Time to complete onboarding
