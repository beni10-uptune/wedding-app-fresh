# Freemium Model Fixes Summary

## 🐛 Issue Fixed
Returning users on free plans were being prompted to pay when logging in, instead of being allowed to use the free tier features.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Auth Redirect Logic (`src/lib/auth-helpers.ts`)
- **Before**: Free users (paymentStatus: 'pending') were redirected to `/wedding/{id}/payment`
- **After**: All users with weddings are redirected to `/dashboard`
- Free users can now access their dashboard and use the app within free tier limits

### 2. Payment Page Updates (`src/app/wedding/[id]/payment/page.tsx`)
- Added "Continue with Free Plan →" link in header
- Added "or continue with the free plan" link below payment form
- Updated title from "Complete Your Journey" to "Upgrade to Premium"
- Added side-by-side comparison of Free vs Premium features
- Changed back button to go to dashboard instead of wedding page

### 3. Create Wedding Flow (`src/app/create-wedding/page.tsx`)
- Fixed serverTimestamp usage for Firestore compatibility
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Added subscriptionTier: 'free' to new weddings
- Better error messages for debugging

## ✅ User Flows Now Working

### New User Flow:
1. Sign up (email or Google) → `/create-wedding`
2. Complete 5-step wedding creation → `/dashboard`
3. Use app with free tier (25 songs, 5 guests)
4. Can upgrade anytime from dashboard

### Returning Free User Flow:
1. Login → `/dashboard` (NOT payment page)
2. Can continue using free tier features
3. See upgrade prompts but not forced to pay
4. Can navigate to payment page voluntarily

### Paid User Flow:
1. Login → `/dashboard`
2. Full access to all features
3. No upgrade prompts
