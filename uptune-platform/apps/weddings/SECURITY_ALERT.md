# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## 1. Exposed API Keys
- **Stripe Secret Keys are in the repository** - These must be rotated immediately in Stripe Dashboard
- Firebase keys are exposed (less critical but should use environment variables in production)

## 2. Missing Security Headers
- No Content Security Policy (CSP)
- No rate limiting on API routes
- No CORS configuration

## 3. Authentication Vulnerabilities
- No session timeout
- No password strength requirements
- Missing 2FA option for high-value accounts

## 4. Data Security
- No encryption for sensitive wedding data
- Guest emails stored in plain text
- No GDPR compliance measures

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Rotate all Stripe keys NOW
2. Remove .env.local from git history
3. Add .env.local to .gitignore
4. Implement proper secret management (Vercel env vars)
5. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
