# Wedding Song Integration Plan ðŸŽµ

## Phase 1: Enhanced Data Collection (Week 1)
### Fetch Additional Spotify Data
- [ ] Popularity scores for ranking
- [ ] Release dates for generational filtering  
- [ ] Artist genres for better categorization
- [ ] Audio features (if API permits):
  - Tempo/BPM for processional timing
  - Energy levels for moment matching
  - Danceability for party songs

### Update Import Script
```typescript
// Add to import script:
- track.popularity
- track.album.release_date
- artist.genres (separate API call)
- track.audio_features (if available)
```

## Phase 2: Smart Categorization (Week 1-2)
### Improve Moment Assignment
- Use tempo for processionals (60-80 BPM)
- Use energy for dance floor (>0.7)
- Use acousticness for dinner (>0.5)
- Use release date for generational appeal

### Create Curated Collections
```typescript
const collections = {
  "Modern Romance": songs.filter(s => s.year > 2020 && s.valence > 0.6),
  "Timeless Classics": songs.filter(s => s.popularity > 70 && s.year < 2000),
  "Indie Wedding": songs.filter(s => s.genres.includes('indie')),
  "Country Wedding": songs.filter(s => s.genres.includes('country')),
  // etc
}
```

## Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements (Week 2-3)

### A. Song Discovery Page
```typescript
interface SongFilters {
  era: Decade[]
  energy: Range<0,1>
  popularity: Range<0,100>
  genres: string[]
  explicit: boolean
  searchQuery: string
}
```

### B. Song Card Component

### C. Moment Builder Enhancement

## Phase 4: Intelligent Recommendations (Week 3-4)

function getRecommendations(wedding: Wedding) {
  return {
    basedOnVenue: getVenueMoodSongs(wedding.venueType),
    basedOnAge: getGenerationalHits(wedding.coupleAge),
    basedOnCurrent: getSimilarSongs(wedding.currentSongs),
    trending: getTrendingWeddingSongs(wedding.date),
    regional: getRegionalFavorites(wedding.location)
  }
}
```

### B. Contextual Suggestions
- "Your processional is 45 seconds, try these songs"
- "Add some 80s hits for the parents"

## Phase 5: Blog Integration (Week 4)
