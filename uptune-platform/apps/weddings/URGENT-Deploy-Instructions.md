# URGENT: Deploy Firestore Rules to Fix Permissions

The "missing permissions" error during wedding creation is likely because the Firestore security rules haven't been deployed to production.

## Quick Fix (Do This Now)

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Deploy the Firestore Rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

## What This Fixes

The Firestore rules define who can read/write to different collections. Without these rules deployed, users can't:
- Create wedding documents
- Create playlist subcollections
- Update their user profile

## Verify the Fix

After deploying:
1. Try the signup flow again
2. You should be able to complete wedding creation without the "missing permissions" error

## Additional Fixes Already Implemented

I've already fixed these issues in the code (just pushed to GitHub):

1. **No More Re-Login**: After signup, users go directly to wedding creation
2. **Name Pre-Population**: Names from signup are automatically filled in wedding creation
3. **Scroll Position**: Page scrolls to top when moving between steps
4. **Better Errors**: Replaced browser alerts with proper error messages

## Next Steps

After deploying the rules and testing:
1. Monitor error logs for any remaining issues
2. Consider implementing the full PRD improvements
3. Add analytics to track conversion rates

## Need Help?

If the rules deployment doesn't fix the issue, check:
- Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules tab (verify they're deployed)
- Browser console for specific error messages
- Firebase project settings (ensure correct project)

The critical fix is deploying those Firestore rules!
